## Getting started with halte

### Create a Python environment
Halte is structured to work from a Conda environment. To create the environment, use the Conda prompt to navigate to the project root directory and enter:
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
This will create a Conda environment named `halte`, with all the dependencies installed (provided you have a working internet connection).
